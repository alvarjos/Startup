# Angel's Startup

[Angel's Notes](notes.md)

I want to create a multiplayer blackjack game where users can join tables, play against each other and the dealer, and track their statistics over time. The game will have real-time updates using WebSockets, user authentication, and a responsive design. The goal is to allow players to enjoy a social game of blackjack from anywhere with friends or other online players.
