            <h2>Objective</h2>
            Get your hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer.
            
            <h2>Card Values</h2>
            Number cards (2–10): Face value<br>
            Face cards (J, Q, K): 10<br>
            Ace (A): 1 or 11 (whichever helps your hand more)<br>
            
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            Each player is dealt 2 cards face up<br>
            Dealer gets 1 card face up and 1 face down (the “hole card”)<br>
            
            <h2>Player Actions</h2>
            Hit: Take another card<br>
            Stand: Keep your current hand<br>
            Bust: If your hand exceeds 21, you lose automatically<br>
            You can hit as many times as you want until you stand or bust.<br>
            
            <h2>Dealer Turn</h2>
            Dealer reveals their face-down card<br>
            Dealer must hit until they reach 17 or higher<br>
            Dealer must stand on 17+<br>
            If the dealer busts, remaining players win<br>
            
            <h2>Determining the winning hand</h2>
            <h4>You win if:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Total is higher than the dealer’s (without busting)</li>
                <li>The dealer busts</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>You lose if:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Your total is lower than the dealer’s</li>
                <li>You bust</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Tie (Push)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If you and the dealer have the same total → no one wins, you keep your bet</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
            Goal: Beat the dealer without going over 21<br>
            Players go first, dealer goes last<br>
            Dealer follows fixed rules, players choose freely<br>
