                <h2>Objective</h2>
                Get your hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over, and beat the dealer.
                
                <h2>Card Values</h2>
                Number cards (2–10): Face value<br>
                Face cards (J, Q, K): 10<br>
                Ace (A): 1 or 11 (whichever helps your hand more)<br>
                
                <h2>Setup</h2>
                Each player is dealt 2 cards face up<br>
                Dealer gets 1 card face up and 1 face down (the “hole card”)<br>
                
                <h2>Player Actions</h2>
                Hit: Take another card<br>
                Stand: Keep your current hand<br>
                Bust: If your hand exceeds 21, you lose automatically<br>
                You can hit as many times as you want until you stand or bust.<br>
                
                <h2>Dealer Turn</h2>
                Dealer reveals their face-down card<br>
                Dealer must hit until they reach 17 or higher<br>
                Dealer must stand on 17+<br>
                If the dealer busts, remaining players win<br>
                
                <h2>Determining the winning hand</h2>
                <h4>You win if:</h4>
                <ul>
                    Total is higher than the dealer’s (without busting)
                    The dealer busts
                </ul>
                <h4>You lose if:</h4>
                <ul>
                    Your total is lower than the dealer’s
                    You bust
                </ul>
                <h4>Tie (Push)</h4>
                <ul>
                    If you and the dealer have the same total → no one wins, you keep your bet
                </ul>
                <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
                Goal: Beat the dealer without going over 21<br>
                Players go first, dealer goes last<br>
                Dealer follows fixed rules, players choose freely<br>
